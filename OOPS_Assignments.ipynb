        "# 1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "# OOP is a programming paradigm that organizes code into objects, which contain data and behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "# A class is a blueprint for creating objects, defining attributes and methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "# An object is an instance of a class with its own attributes and behaviors.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 4. Difference between abstraction and encapsulation\n",
        "# - Abstraction hides implementation details, showing only necessary features.\n",
        "# - Encapsulation restricts direct access to some data, enforcing controlled modification.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "# Special methods with double underscores (e.g., __init__, __str__) that define object behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP\n",
        "# Inheritance allows a class to derive properties and behavior from another class.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "# Polymorphism allows the same function/method to have different implementations.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "# By using private (_var) and protected (__var) attributes and providing getter/setter methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "# The __init__ method initializes object attributes when an instance is created.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "# - Class methods (@classmethod) modify class variables.\n",
        "# - Static methods (@staticmethod) do not access class or instance data.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "# Python does not support method overloading directly but can be achieved using default arguments.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "# Method overriding allows a subclass to provide a different implementation of a method from its parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "# @property allows methods to be accessed as attributes, making property-based access easier.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "# It enables flexible and reusable code, allowing different classes to be treated uniformly.\n",

        "# - __str__: Returns a readable string representation.\n",
